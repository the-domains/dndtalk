description: "From buzzing warplanes to trolling submarines to persistent nuclear posturing, Russia's provocative behavior presents a dilemma for the West. Responding in kind to the Kremlin's provocations risks inflating Moscow's importance and giving Vladimir Putin the status he craves. But not responding, and not attaching a cost to these actions, could just encourage more bad behavior."
