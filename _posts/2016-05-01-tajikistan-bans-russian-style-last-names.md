description: A new law went into effect in Tajikistan on April 29 that bans giving newborn babies last names with Russian-style endings. Tajiks often Russify their surnames when the nation was part of the Soviet Union. The move to now ban the practice is part of a drive by the post-Soviet government to establish a more traditional national identity.
