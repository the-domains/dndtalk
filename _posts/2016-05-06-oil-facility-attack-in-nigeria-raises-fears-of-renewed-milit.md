description: "Nigeria's navy said Thursday that militants attacked an offshore facility belonging to multinational petroleum company Chevron, the latest in a spate of attacks in the petroleum-rich Niger Delta region. The attack raises fears of a renewed militancy in the delta, which was the site of an insurgency by communities demanding a greater share of oil wealth that was quelled only when the government started paying off militants in 2009."
