Paul Quinn-Judge, a senior adviser to the International Crisis Group who just returned from the demarcation line that separates the two sides, attributes the volatile situation to the numbers and proximity of troops along the line of separation, and their willingness to fire on one another.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f88dcdffd98808b934e8ca7928a2e3ae525fb72f.jpg"></article>]]></description>
