Since the latter part of 2015, there has been a noticeable drop in the presence online of IS members based in Syria and Iraq, including some of the most celebrated fixtures in the terror group's propaganda campaign, say researchers with an online monitoring group.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/18933f7f0cf3ee48a3393fb20185782bf4fb1584.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Military Analysts: N. Korean Submarine Missile Launch a 'Successful Failure'</h1><p>North Korea is calling its submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) test on Saturday a "great success," while South Korea labeled it a failure.
